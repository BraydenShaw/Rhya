## **Overview**

Build Your Agent is a comprehensive collection of production-ready intelligent agents designed for real-world scientific research challenges. Our mission is to democratize AI agent development by providing well-architected examples that demonstrate practical design patterns and implementation methods.

We focus on creating agents that follow a systematic architecture: **Perception ‚Üí Planning ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Feedback**, enabling researchers to tackle complex scientific problems with AI-powered assistance.
