I am working on a network dynamics inference task for a networked biophysical neuron system.

The dataset describes the dynamics of a target neuron embedded in a network, where:
	‚Ä¢	x‚ÇÅ represents the membrane potential of the target neuron,
	‚Ä¢	x‚ÇÇ is a fast activation variable (e.g., reflecting fast ion-channel gating),
	‚Ä¢	x‚ÇÉ is a slow adaptation variable (e.g., capturing slow potassium or calcium currents).

In addition, the dataset includes the membrane potentials of other neurons in the network, denoted as x‚ÇÑ, x‚ÇÖ, ..., x_N.
Each of these neurons may influence the target neuron through pairwise interactions.

‚∏ª

üî¨ Research Objective

The goal is to discover the governing equation for the membrane potential dynamics of the target neuron:

y = \frac{dx‚ÇÅ}{dt} = f(x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, x‚ÇÉ) + \sum_{j \ne 1} g(x‚ÇÅ, x_j)

Where:
	‚Ä¢	f(x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, x‚ÇÉ) captures the intrinsic dynamics of the target neuron,
	‚Ä¢	g(x‚ÇÅ, x‚±º) models the interaction effect from neuron j to neuron 1.

There is no magnetic flux modulation involved in this system.
